# Large load-snapshot transfer execution

Plan: `docs/plans/20261025-large-load-snapshot-transfer.md`

The user goal named `plans/brainstorms/20261025-large-load-snapshot-transfer.md`; that path does not exist. The unique matching committed implementation plan is the docs/plans path above. The subsequent explicit goal authorizes implementation; the earlier colleague plan review was unavailable due to provider limits and is not claimed complete. Initial checkout had only the existing untracked review transcript, which is left untouched.

## Task 1 — public contracts, policy and errors

Date: 2026-10-25. Commit: this task commit.

Implemented
- Added load/snapshot Options, protocol/service/status contracts and structured TransferError; no runtime selection, root source files or persistent changes.
- Pure option resolution validates platform/header allocation arithmetic, directional products, chunk/window and timeout sums; defaults are configurable and 64 GiB policy validates without allocation on 64-bit platforms.
- Added 42 unit cases/subtests covering defaults/idempotence, >2 GB settings, explicit budgets, malformed/overflow policy, fault/cause preservation and conservative zero values.

Verified
- go test -count=1 ./load/snapshot: pass.
- go vet ./load/snapshot: pass.
- make test: all 2,182 tests passed across 61 package reports and five application modules; 11.453 seconds.
- Report: test-reports/unit/20261025T163340.128319Z-0wxmtozx/report.md.

Notes
- No large payload, network service, Docker or runtime snapshot test was run in this contract-only task.
- Existing StateMachine/Store APIs, wire paths and immutable fixtures are untouched. Constructor capability enforcement remains deferred to Task 15.

Task 1 validation follow-up
- The first commit hook rejected strict production lint findings (named constants, switch default, grouped DTO style and a conversion whose positive guard was outside its function). No commit was made on failure.
- Fixed the code, including a local positive chunk/window guard before the unsigned conversion. Kept target DTO grouping with narrow max-public-structs exemptions, matching repository conventions.
- make lint (pending files only): pass, including unit/functional vet, production checks, revive and unused analysis.
- Re-ran make test after fixes: all 2,182 tests pass; 6.484 seconds. Report: test-reports/unit/20261025T163713.024365Z-mb3uckv2/report.md.
